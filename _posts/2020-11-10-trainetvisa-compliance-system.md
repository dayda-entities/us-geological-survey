TraiNet is USAID's official training data management system that is accessed from a web browser and the entry point for data about training programs and participants in their country of origin, a third country, or for potential exchange visitors who will come to the United States on a USAID J-1 visa. You must enter data into TraiNet for any program fully or partially funded by USAID. Please see ADS 252 and 253 for additional information on specific policy and procedures.",
