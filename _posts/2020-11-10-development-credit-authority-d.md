USAID's Development Credit Authority (DCA) works with investors, local financial institutions, and development organizations to design and deliver investment alternatives that unlock financing for U.S. Government priorities. Whether it's getting working capital to promising entrepreneurs or input financing to small farmers, DCA seeks to prove the commercial viability of underserved markets so that lending and investment continues long after we exit. The Development Credit Authority (DCA) uses partial credit guarantees to mobilize local financing in developing countries. Guarantee agreements encourage private lenders to extend financing to underserved borrowers in new sectors and regions. By opening up local channels of financing, USAID is empowering entrepreneurs in developing countries at a minimal cost to the U.S. taxpayer. This USAID dataset shows the partial credit guarantees that USAID has issued since the development credit authority program was founded in 1999. The spreadsheet reflects the full facility size of each guarantee, how much was lent under the guarantee, the status of the guarantee (i.e., active or expired), how much in claims the bank submitted due to losses it incurred for loans placed under the guarantee, and how many loans were placed under coverage of the guarantee. The data also shows the sector and country for each guarantee.
