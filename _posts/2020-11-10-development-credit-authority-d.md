USAID's Development Credit Authority (DCA) works with investors, local financial institutions, and development organizations to design and deliver investment alternatives that unlock financing for U.S. Government priorities. USAID guarantees encourage private lenders to extend financing to underserved borrowers in new sectors and regions. This dataset is the complete list of all private loans made under USAID's DCA since it was established in 1999. To protect the personal information of borrowers and bank partners, all strategic and personal identifiable information was removed.
